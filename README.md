# Hi there

I am Caglar Demir.

Since 2019, I have been working as a research fellow at [the Data Science group](https://dice-research.org/) of [Paderborn University](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/). 
As a research fellow, my research interest centers around developing scalable algorithms for learning and reasoning on knowledge graphs.
